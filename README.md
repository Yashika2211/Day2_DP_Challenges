 Day 2 - Dynamic Programming Challenges  

Welcome to my repository! This is part of my **60 Days to Code, Create & Conquer Challenge**.  
Here, I‚Äôve included solutions to two dynamic programming problems I tackled today.

üìù Problems Solved:
1. Climbing Stairs
   - Approach: Optimized using Bottom-Up DP.  
   - Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1).  

2. Longest Common Subsequence  
   - Approach: Solved using a DP table.  
   - Complexity: Time O(n * m), Space O(n * m).  

 üöÄ How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashikaBhatia/Day2_DP_Challenges.git
